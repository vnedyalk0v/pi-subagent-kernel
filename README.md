# Pi SubAgent Kernel

This repository is intended to be the starting documentation set and staged implementation for a better SubAgents implementation for the Pi Coding Agent.

It contains source-backed specifications plus the TypeScript package work as it is built. The documents separate **verified external facts** from **design recommendations** so an AI coding agent can build from them without turning research notes into false requirements.

## Current implementation status

The package exports core contracts, in-memory agent and run registries, safe built-in MVP agent definitions (`scout`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `summarizer`), a `.pi/agents/*.md` loader that requires explicit project trust, and a Pi extension entrypoint that registers the canonical MVP tool names. The tools currently return structured `not_implemented` details; backend execution and tool wiring are later milestone work. `tests/extension/extension.test.ts` is the mock extension-load harness for local validation without a live Pi session.

## What to build

Build a Pi extension/package that provides a stable, safe, observable SubAgents layer:

- Pi-native extension entrypoint with registered tools and slash commands.
- Isolated child agents with a standard lifecycle and result envelope.
- Multiple execution backends: SDK/in-process, subprocess, worktree, mux/tmux, and future remote workers.
- Markdown + YAML agent definitions compatible with Pi/Claude-style agent files and importable from Codex TOML agent files.
- Context isolation by default; no parent transcript dump unless explicitly requested.
- Strict permissions, depth/concurrency/cost/time limits, and project-trust handling.
- Live observability without flooding the main context.

## Source baseline

The documents were prepared from the current public Pi, Codex, and Claude documentation and current Pi package pages checked on **2026-06-26**. Third-party Pi package pages are treated as package-author claims, not independent audits.

## Design promise

> Codex-style explicit parallel agents, Claude-style isolated contexts, and Pi-native extensibility — with durable runs, structured results, safe permissions, and pluggable execution backends.

## First implementation target

The MVP should support:

- `subagent_spawn`, `subagent_status`, `subagent_result`, and `subagent_cancel` tools.
- `/agents` command with a minimal status view.
- Markdown/YAML agent definitions.
- SDK and subprocess backends.
- Standard result envelope.
- Concurrency limit, depth limit, runtime timeout, and tool allowlists.
- Built-in `scout`, `reviewer`, `tester`, and `summarizer` agents; defer `implementer` until write-capable safety exists.

Anything beyond that should be implemented only after the MVP test suite is green.
